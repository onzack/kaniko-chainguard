# Kaniko Container Image

This repository contains a up-to-date container image of [Kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko), based on the forked source code that is being maintained and published by [Chainguard](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/kaniko).

## What is Kaniko?

Kaniko is a tool to build container images from a Dockerfile, inside a container or Kubernetes cluster. It doesn't depend on a Docker daemon and executes each command in a Dockerfile completely in userspace. This enables building container images in environments that can't easily or securely run a Docker daemon, such as a standard Kubernetes cluster.

## Usage

### Gitlab CI pipeline
```
kaniko-build-image:
  stage: build
  image:
    name: ghcr.io/onzack/chainguard-kaniko-debug:latest
    entrypoint: [""]
    pull_policy: always
  before_script:
    - cat <ADDITIONAL CA CERT> >> /kaniko/ssl/certs/additional-ca-cert-bundle.crt
    - |
        mkdir -p /kaniko/.docker
        cat <<EOF > /kaniko/.docker/config.json
        {
          "auths": {
            "<REGISTRY URL>": {
              "auth": "$(echo -n <REGISTRY USER>:<REGISTRY USER PASSWORD> | base64)"
             }
          }
        }
      EOF
      
  script:
    - /kaniko/executor
      --context ${CI_PROJECT_DIR}
      --dockerfile Dockerfile
      --cache=true
      --cache-run-layers
